/**
 *  @brief A model for calculating observed shape moments and their derivatives
 *
 *  This class models the biased weighted moments of an astronomical source given a vector of
 *  moments intrinsic to an object, and a vector of moments representing a weighting function.
 *
 *  The constructor takes the moments of weight function, and the moments of the object
 *  are set by calling the setParameters method. This allows a single instance to be reused to evaluate
 *  multiple positions in object moment space. This structure is computationally more efficient
 *  as well since the weight function would remain constant for many evaluations of image moments
 *
 *  An instance of this class is designed to be used as an objective function in an optimizer
 *  which will find the maximally likely image moments given moments measured from an image.
 *  As such the class provides two methods in addition to the setParameters method already mentioned.
 *  One method computes the biased weighted moments given the specified weight and "true" moments,
 *  and the other computes the derivative of the objective function along each of the image moment
 *  variables.
